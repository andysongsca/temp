      As you might know, NewsBreak is the largest local content provider in the
      United States. Each day, millions of users read content on our platform.

    <p>
      NewsBreak aims to give more autonomy and resources to local writers like you.
      We want to connect your content with broader readers: local community members,
      ordinary Americans, people who are dedicated to serving their cities and
      towns. We believe local content is the core of civic engagement and local
      bond. The excellence and value of your content, will not only reflect on
      simple metrics such as "Impressions" and "Page Views", but on the cohesion among people,
      among the connection between your earnest content and your local readers...

      We are looking forward to seeing your creation.
