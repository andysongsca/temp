				<p dir="ltr">
					Enter a title for the article on the first line. The title should be
					concise (less than 120 characters), descriptive (using location keywords that are related to
					the contents of the article) and engaging (piquing local audience's interest to draw them
          into reading the article.) <b>It’s very important to spend effort on coming up with a
            catchy headline, as it’s the one that entices users to click on your post in the first place.</b>
				</p>
			</li>
			<li dir="ltr">
				<p dir="ltr">
					Enter the content for the article in the text box below the tool bar.
					The word count we
					think work best for the mobile reading experience on our app is
					roughly 300-500.

			<li dir="ltr">
				<p dir="ltr">
					You may put your byline at the top of the article, if it’s different
					from your user name. It
					should look uniform and be unobtrusive unless there's a compelling
					reason to prominently highlight it.

			</li>
			<li dir="ltr">
				<p dir="ltr">
					If you copy and paste the text from somewhere else, read through and
					check no odd
					characters generated during transferring before you publish.

					In order for the app to identify the location of your article, and
					therefore put it into the right target market, make sure you enter the
					city name or zip code in this step. Remember this city you put here should not
          be where you live, or where you publish the story. <b>It should be where
            the story occurred, and where the citizens would care the most.</b>

				<p dir="ltr">
					After you select your location, click <b>Publish.</b>

			</li>

					Or, if you feel like a pause before finishing up your story, click <b>Save as
            draft</b>. You can find it back in the <b>Your Articles</b> – <b>Drafts.</b>

					On your post, go to a new line and click the image icon in the tool
					bar to upload an image from your desktop. There is a size
					limitation which you would see when you upload.

			</li>
			<li dir="ltr">
				<p dir="ltr">
					You must insert at least one image into the article. The first 1-3
					images appear at the top
					of the article will become the thumbnail of this article, which is
					usually the first thing a
          visitor will see. <b>People tend to click on stories with captivating
					featured images, and this
            is a good strategy to increase views.</b>
				</p>
			</li>
			<li dir="ltr">
				<p dir="ltr">
					We highly recommend that you use images taken by yourself. Typically,
					they are more
					relevant to the content of your stories, and do not involve copyright
					issues.
			</p>
			</li>
			<li dir="ltr">
				<p dir="ltr">
					If you do not own the images, you always need to ask permission to
					use the image from the owner and give proper credit. Add a line of
					image caption to credit the photo.
			</p>
			</li>
			<li dir="ltr">
				<p dir="ltr">
					Royalty-free images are your last resort, but they are not the best
					way to address visual content for your post, especially the free

			Track performance:
	</h3>
		<ol>
			<li dir="ltr">
				<p dir="ltr">
					It takes up to 24 hours after you publish your post to see the
					performance, so don’t freak out seeing engagement metrics remaining
					0 for a while.

			<li dir="ltr">
				<p dir="ltr">
					Impressions mean the number of times your post gets displayed in the
					NewsBreak feed
					or related recommendations. Page Views mean the number of people who
					clicked on the
          title and actually read your post. <b>Page Views / Impressions = click-through
					rate (CTR).
            Posts with CTR above 7% are considered great.</b>

					Shares mean the number of times your post get reposted to other
