      <h1>NewsBreak Contributor Content Requirements</h1>

      <p><i>Updated November 2021</i></p>
      <br />
      
      <p>In addition to NewsBreak's <a href="/creator-content-policy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Content Policy</a>, contributors must also follow these requirements:</p>

      <h2>Each article must:</h2>

      <h3>1. Be at least 250 words </h3>
      <p>Each article must include at least 250 words.</p>

      <h3>2. Include at least one image </h3>
      <p>All articles must include at least one image that is relevant to the content. All multimedia must be owned by you or you must have obtained permission to use the media if the multimedia is not free for everyone to use without any restrictions. Every image, including images taken by the contributor, must include a credit to the source. Images on our platform, at a minimum, need to be 201 x 201 pixels. </p>

      <h3>3. Include a headline </h3>
      <p>Every article needs a factually-correct headline that is directly related to the content in the article (no clickbait). The article should be free from grammatical and spelling errors and cannot include links. Please do not use ALL CAPS. </p>

      <h3>4. Be free of distracting formatting </h3>
      <p>Formatting choices should be made with the user in mind. Formatting choices should help guide the reader and not distract or hinder the userâ€™s experience. Contributors should avoid overuse of stylized text features and content should mainly be in regular text. </p>

      <h2>Each video must:</h2>

      <h3>5. Be between 30 seconds and 30 minutes </h3>
      <p>Videos published on our platform should be at least 30 seconds long, but no more than 30 minutes. Best practice for video duration on NewsBreak is <b>one to six</b> minutes. </p>
      <p>Note: if videos are too long they may fail to upload. </p>

      <h3>6. Include a headline and description </h3>
      <p>Headlines and descriptions help users discover and better understand your videos. Therefore, we ask you to include a relevant headline as well as a description for every video. Headlines and descriptions should be free of spelling and grammatical errors. Headlines should be under 100 characters. Please see our Promotional and sponsored guidelines for including links in your description. You should avoid using exaggerated language such as ALL CAPS and/or irrelevant punctuation. </p>

      <h3>7. Be uploaded in a supported format and size </h3>
      <p>Only the following file formats are supported: mov, mp4, webm, mkv, avi, mpeg, m2ts. The file size of a video should be no more than 4 GB. </p>

      <h3>8. Include a video thumbnail </h3>
      <p>Each video must include a thumbnail image. You can upload your own thumbnail that is relevant to the video topic (recommended) or choose to have an auto-generated thumbnail from the video. Thumbnail images must be at least 240 x 240 pixels. </p>

      <h3>9. Include sound </h3>
      <p>Each video should include relevant video sounds. BGM/music/voice over/natural sound/voice are all considered acceptable sounds.  All sounds must be owned by you or you must have obtained permission to use the sounds if the sounds are not free for everyone to use without any restrictions. This especially includes music. </p>

      <h3>10. Have a minimum resolution of 360p </h3>
      <p>All videos should have a minimum resolution of 360p. Best practice is 720p or 1080p. </p>
