      <h1>Creator Monetization Policy</h1>
      <hr />
      <p>Joining the NewsBreak Creator Program (“NBCP”) is a significant step forward in your writing/video career. As part of the NBCP, you can apply for monetization to receive money from your content, as explained further below. A key requirement for the NBCP is to follow NewsBreak’s policies, including this Creator Monetization Policy, <a href="https://creators.newsbreak.com/terms" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">NewsBreak Creator Program Terms of Service</a> (“NBCP Terms”), <a href="/creator-content-policy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Creator Content Policy</a>, <a href="/creator-content-requirements" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">NewsBreak Creator Content Requirements</a> and <a href="/contributor-editorial-standards" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Contributor Network Editorial Standards & Guidelines</a>.</p>
      <p>This Monetization Policy is incorporated into the NBCP Terms by reference and may be amended by us from time to time.</p>
      <h3>To receive money from your content you submit to NewsBreak, you must complete the following steps:</h3>

        <li>Once you meet minimum eligibility requirements, you must set up a Tipalti account (a third party payment platform) through the NewsBreak Creator Portal and apply for monetization.

      <h3>Raising Expectations for Monetization</h3>
      <p>NewsBreak has taken exhaustive efforts to improve its eligibility requirements for monetization. We are always actively working to filter out plagiarizers, imposters, spammers, ranters, and other bad actors, so that the system favors our best creators and encourages them to produce top-quality content. NewsBreak reserves the right to revoke monetization rights at any time, even terminate Creator’s account if it determines, in its sole discretion, that you have violated any NewsBreak terms.</p>
      <h3>Advertiser-Friendly Content</h3>
      <p>Your articles or videos must also be advertiser-friendly in order to qualify for monetization. Your articles or videos may have ads disabled or limited if NewsBreak determines such content is not advertiser-friendly.</p>
      <h3>Non-monetization Publishing Options</h3>
      <p>Even if you are not accepted to monetize your content, you may still submit articles or videos to us that meet our <a href="/creator-content-policy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">NewsBreak Creator Content Policy</a>. Our team will review these articles or videos and decide whether to publish them or not. These articles may be taken into consideration in reviewing your application for monetization in the future. </p>
